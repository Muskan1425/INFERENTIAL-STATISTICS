# INFERENTIAL-STATISTICS

This repository contains code and examples related to inferential statistics. Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that involves making inferences or conclusions about a population based on sample data. This readme provides a brief overview of various concepts and techniques used in inferential statistics.

Concepts Covered
Z-Scores: Z-scores, also known as standard scores, measure how many standard deviations an observation or data point is from the mean of a distribution. They are useful in determining the relative position of a value within a distribution.

Chi-Square Test: The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It compares the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.

t-test: The t-test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups. It assesses whether the means are statistically different from each other.

Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.

A/B Testing: A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a technique used to compare two versions of a webpage or an application to determine which one performs better. It is often used in marketing and product development to optimize user experience and engagement.

Mann-Whitney U Test: The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the distributions of two independent samples. It is an alternative to the t-test when the data do not meet the assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variance.

One-Way ANOVA: One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test used to determine if there are any significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. It compares the variance between the groups with the variance within the groups.

P-value: The p-value is a statistical measure used to determine the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of observing the data or more extreme data under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A lower p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

Each concept or technique in this repository is accompanied by code examples and explanations to help you understand and apply inferential statistics in your own projects.
